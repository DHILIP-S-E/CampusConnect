                    <h2>Introduction to Mindfulness</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present moment—and accepting it without judgment. Mindfulness is now being examined scientifically and has been found to be a key element in stress reduction and overall happiness.</p>
                    
                    <div class="quote-box">

                <h3>Getting Started with Mindfulness</h3>
                <p>Mindfulness doesn't require special equipment or a lot of time. Here are some simple exercises to begin your practice:</p>
                
                <div class="meditation-exercise">
                    <h4>1. Mindful Breathing (5 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>This foundational practice helps anchor your attention to the present moment through your breath.</p>
                    
                    <ol class="step-list">
                        <li>Find a comfortable seated position with your back straight but not rigid.</li>
                        <li>Close your eyes or maintain a soft gaze downward.</li>
                        <li>Bring your attention to your breath, noticing the sensation of air moving in and out of your body.</li>
                        <li>When your mind wanders (which is normal), gently bring your attention back to your breath without judgment.</li>
                        <li>Continue for 5 minutes, gradually increasing the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="meditation-exercise">
                    <h4>2. Body Scan (10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>This practice helps you develop awareness of physical sensations and release tension in the body.</p>
                    
                    <ol class="step-list">
                        <li>Lie down or sit comfortably with your eyes closed.</li>

                        <li>Gradually shift your attention to your feet, noticing any sensations present.</li>
                        <li>Slowly move your attention upward through your body—ankles, legs, hips, abdomen, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and head.</li>
                        <li>If you notice areas of tension, breathe into them and imagine the tension dissolving as you exhale.</li>
                        <li>Complete the practice by returning awareness to your whole body and taking a few deep breaths.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>Notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.</li>
                        <li>Return to your breath for the remaining time, allowing your mind to rest.</li>
                        <li>When the timer ends, notice how you feel before returning to your work.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Begin with just 3-5 minutes daily and gradually increase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Same time, same place:</strong> Create a routine by practicing at the same time and location each day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use reminders:</strong> Set alarms or place visual cues in your environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be kind to yourself:</strong> If you miss a day, simply begin again without self-criticism.</li>
                        <li><strong>Track your progress:</strong> Keep a simple journal noting how you feel before and after practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Link to existing habits:</strong> Practice after brushing your teeth or before meals to build consistency.</li>
